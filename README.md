## About Bounce Bounce
Bounce bounce is a game where a pointer moves along a track trying to hit a set orange part of it. This game runs VERY fast. It has the canvas element to draw the screen, and calculations are very small. This should run fine if you're not running a potato. This game can be played on basically anything with an up-to-date version of chrome, firefox, opera, and edge.
## How to play
Press space when the black slider reaches the orange part.
